# A Short Note about the future of geometry3Sharp

I have not been able to work on or maintain geometry3Sharp for the past few years, due to some restrictive employment-contract terms. Various forks now exist that have active maintainers, and I would recommend you consider switching to one of those. In particular I would recommend the geometry4Sharp fork being developed by New Wheel Technology (_who also does C# development consulting, if you are looking for that_):

https://github.com/NewWheelTech/geometry4Sharp

# geometry3Sharp

Open-Source (Boost-license) C# library for geometric computing. 

geometry3Sharp is compatible with Unity. Set the G3_USING_UNITY Scripting Define and you will have transparent interop between g3 and Unity vector types (*see details at the very bottom of this README*). Although the library is written for C# 4.5, if you are using the .NET 3.5 Unity runtime, it will still work, just with a few missing features.

Currently there is a small amount of unsafe code, however this code is only used in a few fast-buffer-copy routines, which can be deleted if you need a safe version (eg for Unity web player).

[A Nuget Package is available](https://www.nuget.org/packages/geometry3Sharp). This package is updated roughly monthly from the github master branch. So, it's "more" stable. Currently this package includes .NET 4.5 and .NET Standard 2.0 dlls. If you would like others, please email and they can be added.

# Credits

Many, many data structures and algorithms have been ported from the WildMagic5 and GTEngine C++ libraries, which are developed by David Eberly at [Geometric Tools](https://www.geometrictools.com/). WildMagic5 and GTEngine are distributed under the Boost license as well, available [here](https://www.geometrictools.com/Downloads/Downloads.html). Any errors in code marked as ported from WildMagic5/GTEngine are most certainly ours!

The **MeshSignedDistanceGrid** class was implemented based on the C++ [SDFGen](https://github.com/christopherbatty/SDFGen) code written by [Christopher Batty](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~c2batty/) and [Robert Bridson](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/).

# Unity Interop

geometry3Sharp supports transparent conversion with Unity types.
To enable this, define **G3_USING_UNITY** in your Unity project, by adding this
string to the **Scripting Define Symbols** box in the **Player Settings**.  

Once enabled, code like this will work transparently:

~~~~
Vector3 unityVec;
Vector3f g3Vec;
unityVec = g3vec;
g3vec = unityVec;
~~~~

float->double types will work transparently, while double->float will require an explicit cast:

~~~~
Vector3d g3vecd;
g3vecd = gameObject.transform.position;
gameObject.transform.position = (Vector3)g3vecd;
~~~~

This will work for **Vector2**, **Vector3**, **Quaterion**, **Ray**, **Color**, and **Bounds** (w/ AxisAlignedBox3f)
Note that these conversions will **not** work for equations, so to add a Vector3f and a Vector3, you
will need to explicitly cast one to the other.
